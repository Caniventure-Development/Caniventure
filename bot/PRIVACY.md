## User Privacy

### What information does Caniventure collect?

- Discord User ID
- Public Discord Profile Information _(Username, Avatar, etc.)_

We do not collect any private information _(such as passwords or credit card numbers)_ from Discord whatsoever.

### How do we use this data?

We use the User ID to create your data in the database as a part of the main functionality of the bot.

### Why do we use this data?

We use this data to create your profile and store your data in the database, it is required to effectively use the bot.

A good side note, when using PvP _(which is not ready yet)_ (or another example: the `userinfo` command), we do not create a document in the database for the target player against their will. The target player has to run one of the commands that creates a document in the database _(for example `/predator eat`)_ before you can target them.

### Does anybody else see my data?

The people at MongoDB _may_ see your data in the database. Please read their [privacy policy](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy) for more information.

### Where can I contact the Caniventure team?

You can contact the team in the [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HQn5cyrG3a).

### Can my data be deleted?

Yes, you can have all your data deleted and optionally request a backup of your data by getting in contact with the team. Rest assured, soon after you file the request _(and we receive it)_, your data will be deleted from the database.

## Guild Privacy

### What information does Caniventure collect for guilds?

- Guild ID

### Why do we use this data for guilds?
