# Caniventure Terms

Caniventure is a free-to-use bot, but due to its niche nature and the fact it targets what some people call a kink, others call a fetish... we have some terms mainly to protect everyone that uses this bot.

**By using Caniventure, you agree to these terms. Any violation of these terms may result in being blacklisted. Do not use Caniventure if you don't agree to these terms.**

## We allow

- Using the bot for its intended purpose as an economy bot.
- Using the source code of the bot, while respecting the GPL license.
- Doing **SAFE FOR WORK** roleplay with this bot, since that's always fun.
- Using the bot if you're at least the [legal age for Discord in your jurisdiction](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050817374-Age-restriction).

## We do NOT allow

- Using the bot for illegal purposes _(soliciting children, pornography, etc.)_.
- Exploiting any unintended mechanics of the bot.
- Harassment, witch hunting or otherwise hurting people for using the bot. **Everyone who uses the bot is a person, remember that.**
- Being Xenophobic or Discriminatory against people who use the bot. **Again, same rule applies!**
- Violating the GPL license on the source code, or using the source code to make a blatant copy/malware.
- Using the bot if you're underage for Discord.

---

**We reserve the right to blacklist ANYONE who violates these terms. So do not break them. :)**
