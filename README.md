# Caniventure

Welcome to Caniventure, a brand new economy bot that does something most Discord bots never do. Try to be unique (I know, shots fired).

**Most economy bots handle themselves by doing a `/work` -> `/beg` -> `/whatever`** system. **Not Caniventure.** You earn money by hunting living things and eating them alive.

## Features

- Fully unique
- Two currencies, **Bones** and **Money**
- Character system
- Immersive role play potential

## Warning

This bot is in alpha, so it's still being heavily developed. Stuff can change over time. Also... this bot does target **fetish material** but uses language that stays suitable for general audiences (really anyone who's **ALLOWED** to be on Discord in the first place). Keep that in mind.
