    <h2>Why do we collect this data?</h2>
    <p>We collect this data so you can be able to use Caniventure as the economy bot it is, without it, the bot would just be a glorified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ping bot</a>.</p>
